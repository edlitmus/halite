# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-09

P1 progress (see docs/salt-parity.md for the remaining items).

* file.managed / file.directory: `user`/`group` ownership with drift
  detection; -/+ line diffs in Changes (`show_diff: false` to suppress).
* Universal gates: `creates`, `unless`, `onlyif` now work on every state,
  evaluated by the engine (previously cmd.* only).
* New modules: user.present/absent, group.present/absent (pw(8),
  useradd/usermod, sysadminctl, net user), cron.present/absent
  (identifier-marker managed crontab entries), sysctl.present
  (runtime + sysctl.conf/sysctl.d persistence).
* `halite apply -json` for machine-readable results.
* Template funcs: default, contains, split, join, lower, upper,
  hasPrefix, hasSuffix.
* yamlite: double-quoted scalars now process \n/\t/\r escapes per YAML
  semantics; single quotes remain literal.
* Test-mode fix: file ownership referencing a user/group created by an
  earlier state no longer fails during `-test`.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-09

Initial release: masterless engine (`apply`, `call`, `grains`), yamlite
parser, text/template rendering, require/watch requisites, file/pkg/
service/cmd modules, cross-platform backends.
